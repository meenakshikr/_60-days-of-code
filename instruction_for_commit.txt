Hey evey one for a github repo to be confict free we have to follow certain commit rules
1.For every change we would be adding a branch 
2. The branch would be named like :
    CD-number:Type of feature and location of feature 
    further push your branch 
    example : CD-02:Instruction for git commits
3. A git commit should be like :
    CD-number(same as branch number ):Work done in commit 
    further do your commit . 
    example : CD-02:Adding instruction_for_commit.txt

Before merging one review should be done by other team mate 
Also you can find Git_basics.pdf and git_cheatsheet.pdf these files can be found in Help_Git folder for github commits .
For any update that u make :
1. Create a branch on github .
2. Type "git checkout main " on terminal and hit enter .
